# Movie database challenge

This is my submission for test challenge to implement basic crud UI that fetches data from themoviedb in under one hour.

## Why express.js?

1) It's simplier. I will not need to build a separate clientside application.

2) It's secure. The app will not leak the api key to the public

3) Indexable by search engines out of the box.

## Installation

1) `npm install`
2) `node index.js`
3) navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
